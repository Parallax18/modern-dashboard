# Modern dashboard

For this application, I used Nextjs, Typescript, Chakraui and React-query.

        yarn
        yarn dev

### API FOLDER
Logic and services relating to API interactions are found in the “api” folder.
#

### COMPONENTS
Component and UI are in the “components” folder.
#

### HOOKS
The hooks folder contains files with logic for key parts of the application handling data flow and structure
#

### UTILS
Utils folder contains utility functions.
#

For the chart data, I have used the data from the API for “all time” and randomly generated values for the other five number of days.
#

I implemented the time of day functionality to show the user a different greeting depending on when they open the application
#

You would also notice that the top-records cards - “top location” and “top referral source” look slightly different from the figma file, this is because I have used flags and country colours based on the data coming from the API, as it varies with what is on the figma file.
